    <!-- About Content -->
    <div class="document">
        <h1>Want to develop for UndChain?</h1>
        <p class="status">UndChain is under development at this time; UndChain 
            also has a developer fund that helps support new developers 
            coming in. This allows developers to earn coins while they develop, 
            this is done by using something called the <b>bounty</b> system.
            This system allows anyone to come in and contribute code and earn
            based on the value of what they provided. <I>This also applies to 
            documentation and graphics.</I>
        </p>

        <h2>Core Development</h2>
        <p>This involves the fundamental protocols with UndChain. 
            Things such as network communications, cryptographic protocols, 
            standardizing packet types, defining user types (Chain Owner, 
            Validator, Partner, Client) as well as how they 
            are meant to interact on the network. We are also working on scaling
            via sub-netting the network to allow more Validators to spread the 
            load. 
        </p>

        <h2>Co-Chain Development</h2>
        <p>This portion of development is meant for co-chains which is how
            UndChain can expand it's functionality (like importing a module).
            The co-chains that are currently under development are using Python 
            rather than using Pseudo (our Pythonic programming language). Those
            Co-Chains are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auction House</b> - A digital asset trading platform</li>
            <li><b>Pages</b> - Decentralized websites</li>
            <li><b>SQeeL</b> - Decentralized database</li>
            <li><b>Mimic</b> - AI framework</li>
            <li><b>Code Ledger</b> - Software repository system</li>
            <li><b>Smack</b> - Social media framework</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to join?</h2>
        <p>We do not have an effective means of joining at this time other than
            reaching out via our social media contacts. Please feel free to DM, 
            please be sure to introduce yourself and state what you would like to
            see or offer the project. Even if you believe it's small or if you 
            know someone who might be interested. The goal is to have permissionless
            development using <b>Code Ledger</b> which will natively provide rewards
            based on the contribution you are providing.
