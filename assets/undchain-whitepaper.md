# What is UndChain

UndChain is a PoU (Proof of Utility) blockchain; that can best be thought of as a decentralized cloud service in which anyone can participate. There are three different utilities that can be performed on the network, that work together to create similar functionality as conventional cloud service providers.

1. **Computation** - The thought behind this function would be items that either are too complex for a ordinary machine to complete in a reasonable amount of time (training AI models, 3D rendering or DNA sequencing) or something that requires modifying data that must be shared with a group (think servers).

2. **Storage** - In order to compute you must have access to data to compute on. UndChain has storage built into it's language so you don't have to use another service. This allows for things such as databases and the ability to store large AI models. 

3. **Access** - This is a functionality that will be expanded more in the future, but for now think of this as the ability to have access to specialty equipment in a specific location such as linking two or more users together, surrogates or VPN like services. When fully realized it is meant to replace the IP protocol by enable secure communications that are digital signed from the source.

 When mixing these three utility types this will enable a full cloud experience that can do things such as spin up gaming servers, webpages and virtual computers. What makes this different than the way the internet is ran today is that anyone can participate and earn rewards for providing utility to the network. This reduces the need for missive data centers and spreads out computational resources throughout the network. This will **NOT** eliminate centralized services, in fact there will be ways (via access) in which you can still direct to a centralized service. The goal of the network is to allow both the centralized and the decentralized systems to co-exist and allow the consumer to choose.

# Co-Chains

Co-Chains is how the network expands it's abilities and services. Anyone can own a co-chain, in fact there is a classification of user called chain owners mentioned later. The goal of a co-chain should be to expand the functionality of the network and not to make new coins as such it is up to the chain owner if they wish to create a new token or use the blockchain's native token. The chain owner can still set their fees even with the native chains token just as they can with their own. The difference is you cannot control the emission rate nor the quantity. The goal in doing this is to attempt to reduce the amount of tokens that go in circulation. It also simplifies the usability of the blockchain the less swaps that need to be performed at the action house. 

## Why Co-Chains?

The purpose of utilizing co-chains rather than having layer 2 blockchains are multifaceted

1. It allows for better security since at each block completion a co-chain blends it's hash with a co-chain it's linked to, which reduces the risk of a attack on the network.

2. It expands Pseudo (UndChain's Pythonic programing language), by allowing others to import functions from other chains. You can choose to private a function or set fees on it. Remember you own it...

3. It provides a sense of ownership for your work and allows you to monetize on it so you can continue to make it better and help you with your personal goals. The goal of UndChain is digital ownership. 

4. I think it's better than saying layer two; you're a creator on this network not a leach and you should be recognized for it. Even the main chain is a co-chain. *Note: I will do some verbiage changes in here that I believe are more accurate and beneficial to the industry.*
